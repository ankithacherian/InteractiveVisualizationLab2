# Data Visualization and analysis-lab2
The purpose of Lab2 coursework is to use different CSS effects like pulse actions using @keyframes, hovering
and other CSS styling.

Part2 of the coursework dealt with different events mainly the mouse events (mouseout 
and mouseover) and binding of the events to the DOM elements.  
d3. pointer was used to get the X and Y coordinates based on mouse position and 
to display value of charts or graphs as texts. 

Part 3 tasks were based on various transition concepts like easing effects, setting duration and delay time for transitions to take place. 
Transactions based on Changing data with a click event or mouse event were also implemented.

Using Interpolate functions like d3. interpolate(a,b), d3.interpolateNumber(a,b),d3,interpolateDate(a,b) etc, we could find the intermediate values for a given set of 
number, array, colour, date etc. 

Lastly, we used d3. force layout to translate the nodes to specific position pulling 
to the center and the collision function to prevent nodes from overlapping.

This lab work helped in demonstrating a variety of skills, such as, problem solving, communication skills, time-
management and so on. The labs were structured to encourage a mix of guided and active learning, innovative
development, critical thinking and knowledge-based expertise of the subject.
